    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These fudgy Black Forest bars are a decadent dessert that is somewhere between brownie and cake, loaded with chocolate and bathed in cherries. They're fabulous with coffee.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup salted butter, softened</li>
        <li>1.5 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsweetened triple chocolate baking cocoa</li>
        <li>1 large dark chocolate bar, chopped into chunks (about 1 cup chunks)</li>
        <li>1 (21 ounce) can cherry pie filling</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon confectioners sugar(optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180 degrees C. Grease a 9x13-inch pan.</li>
        <li>Beat butter and sugar together in a bowl with an electric mixer until creamy. Beat in vanilla. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating in each egg completely before adding the next.</li>
        <li>Stir in flour and cocoa powder until fully combined. Stir in chocolate chunks.</li>
        <li>Spread mixture into prepared pan, then pour pie filling over the top, smoothing it out.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes, then check for doneness. A toothpick inserted near the center should come out with just a few moist crumbs. Bake up to 10 minutes more, if needed.</li>
        <li>Cool completely; sprinkle with confectionerâ€™s sugar. Cut into bars.</li>
    </ol>
