        <li>1 (12-count) package artisan soft bakery rolls</li>
        <li>24 small slices sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon olive or avocado oil</li>
        <li>1 pound 80% lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1/2 large white onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garlic paste</li>
        <li>1 cup ketchup</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chili powder and/or cumin</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>3/4 cup water</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Glaze</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup butter, melted</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ketchup</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>Sesame or poppy seeds</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Cut rolls in half and lay bottom halves on the sheet. Place a piece of cheese on each bottom half. Set tops aside and cover baking sheet with a tea towel while working on the filling.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and saute for 1 minute, then add ground beef. Cook until browned and crumbly, breaking the meat up with a spoon, and onion is soft, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain grease, then add garlic. Stir to combine and lower heat to medium-low.</li>
        <li>Stir ketchup, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, Dijon mustard, and chili powder together in a small bowl. Add to the cooked beef, then stir in water. Simmer on low, stirring frequently, until thickened to your taste, 5 to 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Place a heaping spoonful of meat mixture over cheese on the bottom half of rolls. Cover the meat mixture with another slice of cheese. Replace the tops.</li>
        <li>For glaze, mix butter, brown sugar, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, and Dijon mustard together in a small bowl. Brush over tops of rolls, then sprinkle each roll top with sesame or poppy seeds.</li>
        <li>Bake sliders, uncovered, in the preheated oven, until cheese is melted and tops are nicely browned, about 20 minutes. Serve with BBQ sauce, ketchup, or yellow mustard for dipping.</li>
    </ol>
